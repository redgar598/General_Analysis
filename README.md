# General_Analysis
Scripts, data objects and figures of general interest for 450K analysis. This is developed through many people, feel free to make a branch to make changes but we will have to all agree on changes for the master. Make pull requests if you have made helpful changes to the code, espically if your changes make the code more generally useful (and therefore a better master copy).
